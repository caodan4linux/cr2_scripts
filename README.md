# CR2_Scripts

The CR2_Scripts project consists of a set of scripts for converting
[Canon RAW](http://lclevy.free.fr/cr2/) format files to and from
[Netpbm](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/) format files.

Documentation is available as follows:
- Brief user documentation is available for each script by passing the
   conventional '-h' or '--help' parameter.
- An introduction to CR2_Scripts can be found in the following blog post:

# Prerequisites

The scripts are written in python, as far as possible in a platform-indepedent
way. However, they have only been tested on a 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS system.
To use this software you need the following installed on your system:

- Python v2.7.6
- Numpy v1.8.2
- Matplotlib v1.3.1
- PVRG JPEG v1.2.1

Later versions, with the notable exception of Python v3.x, should also work.
